<h1>Applications</h1>

<p>
Many discussions surrounding programming languages are dogmatic rather than pragmatic.
On the one hand, in dogmatic discussions, each participant has a favorite language, and their main goal is to show why their favorite language is better.
No one is genuinely interested in learning the shortcomings of their favorite.
On the other hand, in pragmatic discussions, participants aim to achieve some task, and their main goal is to inform each-other about pros and cons of choosing various languages.
Typically, it turns out there is no best language &ndash; just trade-offs.
And picking the &lsquo;right&rsquo; trade-off is not a science but a craft that one can learn only by prolonged deliberate practice.
It is foremost a matter of attitude: one must regularly approach new languages, let go of any preconceptions, and try in earnest to solve real problems in its.
While doing so, one must actively pay attention to what works well.
(Annoyances will insinuate themselves into one's attention, so there's no need to actively try to pay attention to them.)

<p>
The goal of the first half of the module is to give examples of this process.
We pick a task.
We solve it in at least a couple of languages.
And we pay attention at what works well.
In the process, we may even be lucky learn some general lessons.

<p>
In this half of the module, I will assume that you are a competent programmer.
That means that you can learn on your own the syntax and the basics of a programming language.
This may come across as highly unusual: Shouldn't this module <i>teach</i> you several languages?
No.
This module will simply ask you to learn a couple of new languages on your own.
What you learn in this first half of the module is what kind of internal dialogue you should have when you approach a new language.
This dialogue will typically involve high-level concepts, but applied in a concrete context.
I will not discuss syntax: the compiler will dutifully complain, and with a brief Google search you can find a fix.
Instead, I will direct your attention towards questions you <i>should</i> be thinking about, even though the compiler won't force you:
Will this program scale to multiple computers?
What kind of changes are likely to be made in the future to this program and what might break?
What information should I encode in the types and what should I put in comments?
Should I use a third-party library or should I code it myself?
What data-structure is more efficient?
What data-structure is more likely to adapt to future requirements?
For which data-structure will the compiler help me most to get it right?
And so on &hellip;
These are the kind of questions you should continuously be asking yourself.

<p>
Without further ado, here is the matrix of languages and problems we look at:
