<h1>Coin Change</h1>

<p>
You work at the Library Cafe.
Somebody just ordered an espresso, which costs $1.40$, and paid with a tenner.
You need to give change.
You have no notes but lots of coins of each kind.
You want to minimize the number of coins that you hand over.
How do you do it?

<p>
Let $d_1,\ldots,d_m$ be the denominations available, and let $c_{i,j}$ be the minimum number of coins necessary to pay the sum $j$ if we are allowed to use only the first $i$ denominations, namely $d_1,\ldots,d_i$.
When we pay $j$ with the first $i$ denominations, we either use $d_i$ or we don't:

$$
  c_{i,j} = \min \{ 1 + c_{i,j-d_i},\ c_{i-1,j} \}
$$

If we cannot pay $j$ with the first $i$ denominations, we let $c_{i,j}:=\infty$.
In particular, we cannot pay negative amounts.
We also make the convention that $c_{0,0}:=0$.

<h2>Input/Output</h2>

<p>
<b>Input:</b>
whitespace separated integers
$n,d_1,\ldots,d_m$,
where $n$ is the sum we need to pay, and $d_1,\ldots,d_m$ are the available denominations.

<p>
<b>Output:</b>
One integer representing the minimum number of coins necessary to pay sum $n$.

<h2>Exercises</h2>
