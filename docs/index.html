<h1>Programming Languages:<br/> Applications and Design</h1>

<p>
This module has two halves.

<ol>
<li><a href="applications/index.html">Applications:</a>
  we solve three problems in three languages,
  and we discuss how different solutions to the same problem compare.
<li><a href="design/index.html">Design</a>:
  we cover basics of programming language theory,
  building on the examples from the first half
</ol>

<p>
The assessment has four components.

<ol>
<li><b><a href="classes.html">Classes [15 points]:</a></b>
  <ol>
    <li>[9 points] you will solve three problems, each in three languages
    <li>[6 points] you will solve on-paper problems related to typing and semantics
  </ol>
<li><b><a href="homework.html">Programming Homework [30 poins]:</a></b>
  you will implement a dependency manager
<li><b><a href="essay.html">Paper Presentation [25 points]:</a></b> you will prepare a
  presentation (in groups) summarising a research paper related to programming
  languages
<li><b>Two-hour examination [30 points]:</b>
  <ol>
  <li>[15 points] for solving (on paper) a problem in two languages, and comparing the solutions
  <li>[15 points] for programming language theory
  </ol>
</ol>

<p>
Note that the points add up to 100.
The module spec <i>should</i> have the numbers as above.
SDS <i>should</i> have the coursework components expressed as percentages of total coursework; for example, the dependency solver programming homework should be listed as 30/(15+30+25)&approx;43%.
With hope and prayers, admin will eventually get this right.
