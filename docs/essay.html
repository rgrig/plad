<h1>Paper presentations</h1>
<p>For the second assessment, you will choose a scientific paper from
the list below, read it, understand it, and <b>present</b> it to
the class <b> in groups of 3</b>.

<p> The presentation will last 12 minutes and and we expect you
to <b>speak for 10 minutes</b> and keep 2 minutes for questions/discussions.
  
 
<p>The main objectives of this assignment is to gain some experience
  in reading scientific papers on programming languages and learn new
  cutting edge and/or influential results in the area that have had an
  impact on today's programming languages.



<h2>List of papers</h2>


  <b>/!\ At most one group per paper /!\</b> strikethrough = taken.
  
  <p> Choose one paper from the list below :

</ol>

Feel free to use additional material to complement your preparation. Some papers have shorter/longer version available online, for others you will find slides or videos.

<h2>Important dates</h2>

<p>The deadlines are as follows:

<ul>
  <li><b>Friday Week 20:</b> announce which paper you have
  chosen to Julien by email.
  <li><b>Week 23/24:</b> individual paper presentations in room TBD.
  <li><b>Friday Week 24:</b> submit your presentation (slides) via moodle.
</ul>


<h2>Guidelines</h2>

<p>We don't expect you to understand every single technical details in
the paper you have chosen. A good presentation would show that you
have understood the "big picture" (e.g., what is the main idea the
authors are presenting? what problems are they trying to solve?) and
that you have understood <b>some</b> of the technicalities (in
particular regarding the semantics and type systems for the language
presented).


  
<p> Feel free to post <b>any</b> questions you might
have on <a href="http://piazza.com/kent.ac.uk/spring2018/co663">piazza</a>.
If needed, we will dedicate time during classes and lectures for
discussing answers to these questions.

<p>For this assessment, you can safely ignore the proofs and
  algorithmic aspects of these papers.

<p>The <a href="https://blog.acolyer.org/">morning paper</a> has a
good blog post
on <a href="https://blog.acolyer.org/2018/01/26/a-practitioners-guide-to-reading-programming-languages-papers/">how
to read a programming language paper</a>. The blog contains also lots
of examples of good paper summaries. You can use this sort of summaries as
a template for your presentations.

  <p>See
  also <a href="http://www.pl-enthusiast.net/2015/05/27/what-is-pl-research-and-how-is-it-useful/">What
  is PL research and how is it useful?</a> on

      Enthusiast</a>.


    <h2>Marking criteria</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Understanding:</b> does the presentation demonstrate a good understanding of the paper?</li>
      <li><b>Coverage:</b> does the presentation give a complete <i>overview</i> of the source material?</li>
      <li><b>Evaluation:</b> does the presentation demonstrate a critical evaluation of the paper?</li>
      <li><b>Clarity:</b> is the presentation clear/accessible to the audience?</li> 
      <li><b>PL theory:</b> does the presentation make clear links with the lectures?</li>
      <li><b>Group work:</b> are all the members of the group participating in the presentation?</li>
    </ul>
