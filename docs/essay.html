<h1>Paper presentations</h1>

<p>For the second assessment, you will choose a scientific paper from
the list below, read it, understand it, and present it individually to
the CO663 team.

<p> The presentation/viva will last 15 minutes and and we except you
to speak for 10 minutes and keep 5 minutes for questions/discussions.
  
 
<p>The main objectives of this assignment is to gain some experience
  in reading scientific papers on programming languages and learn new
  cutting edge and/or influential results in the area that have had an
  impact on today's programming languages.



<h2>List of papers</h2>

<p>
Choose <b>one</b> paper from the list below:

<ul>
  <li> <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/papers/fj-toplas.pdf">Featherweight

  <li> <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/need-journal/need-journal.ps">The call-by-need Lambda Calculus</a> by 	John Maraist, Martin Odersky, and Philip Wadler
  <li> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/LICS.1993.287570">Typing and subtyping for mobile processes</a> by Benjamin C. Pierce and Davide Sangiorgi.
  <li> <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/amal/papers/linloc-fi07.pdf">L3: A linear language with locations</a> by Amal Ahmed, Matthew Fluet, and Greg Morrisett
  <li> One paper from the member of the <a href="https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/research/groups/plas/people.html">PLAS group at Kent</a> (<b>check with Julien that the paper you choose is suitable</b>)
</ul>

<p>
You can study the papers in groups, but you will be expected to
prepare the presentation material and give the
presentation <b>individually</b>.

<h2>Important dates</h2>

<p>The deadlines are as follows:

<ul>
  <li><b>Friday Week 19 (01/03/18):</b> announce which paper you have
  chosen to Julien by email.
  <li><b>Friday Week 22 (23/03/18):</b> submit a <i>preliminary</i>
  paper summary (text document) or presentation (slides) via moodle.
  <li><b>Week 23/24:</b> individual paper presentations/vivas in Julien's
  office (SW13).
</ul>


<h2>Guidelines</h2>

<p>We don't expect you to understand every single technical details in
the paper you have chosen. A good presentation would show that you
have understood the "big picture" (e.g., what is the main idea the
authors are presenting? what problems are they trying to solve?) and
that you have understood <b>some</b> of the technicalities (in
particular regarding the semantics and type systems for the language
presented).


  
<p> Feel free to post <b>any</b> questions you might
have on <a href="http://piazza.com/kent.ac.uk/spring2018/co663">piazza</a>.
If needed, we will dedicate time during classes and lectures for
discussing answers to these questions.

<p>For this assessment, you can safely ignore the proofs and
  algorithmic aspects of these papers.

<p>The <a href="https://blog.acolyer.org/">morning paper</a> has a
good blog post
on <a href="https://blog.acolyer.org/2018/01/26/a-practitioners-guide-to-reading-programming-languages-papers/">how
to read a programming language paper</a>. The blog contains also lots
of examples of good paper summaries. You can use this sort of summaries as
a template for yours.
