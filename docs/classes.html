<h1>Classes</h1>

<p>
The classes for applications are worth 9 points.
The classes for design are worth 6 points.

<h2>Applications</h2>

<p>
The 9 points are given for solving 9 problems, 5 in Haskell and 4 in Rust.
You will receive an invitation by email to a test on HackerRank.
(This is a platform used by many companies to filter candidates for software engineering positions.)
You should receive the invitation for the Haskell test in Week 15, and the invitation for the Rust test in Week 17.
If you did not receive the invitation, please let us know.

<p>
During classes, you can ask for help with the following tutorials:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://learn.hfm.io/">Learning Haskell</a>
<li>
  <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example">Rust by Example</a>
  <b>or</b>
  <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/">The Rust Book</a>
  (your choice)
</ul>

<p>
Your are probably ready for the Haskell test once you went through the first 3 sections of the Haskell tutorial.
You are probably ready for the Rust test once you went through the first 9 sections of Rust by Example or through the first 6 sections in The Rust Book.


<h2>Design</h2>

<p>
See the Moodle page.
